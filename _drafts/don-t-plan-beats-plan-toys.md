**BLUF:** Let narrative emerge from the connections made by players between notable moments. 



1. Don't worry about plot
   1. Plot is found in movies
   2. Plot is not something you can emulate in a game without compromising on player agency. 
   3. What we perceive as plot in a movie is just the meaningful connection between cause and effect.
2.  Narrative is just the connections between notable occurrences linked by cause and effect 
   1. You need notable occurances
   2. You need to reinforce Cause and effect
3. Notable occurrences happen when the status quo is disrupted. 
   1. The notable occurrences are disruptions of some kind of status quo. 
   2. Something about the world is different because this happened. 
   3. If nothing about the player's world is different than what was the point?
4. Cause and effect is the key to player agency
   1. The biggest hurdle to DMs letting go is thinking that they need to make sure players do things in order. 
   2. The only order that really matters is cause and effect. A happens and because of that B happens and because of that C and so on and so forth. 
   3. As long as the players can see how their decisions got them to where they are it will be fun. 
5. So don't worry about scripting just create some interesting toys to toss around in the sandbox and let your players connect them. 
6. Keys to success:
   1. Make sure the players have informed choices. They need to understand risk, reward and trade offs. 
   2. If players see only effect and no cause they will feel surprised and not in a good way
   3. If the players see causes but no effect they will ignore them since they don't seem to shape base reality. 



As a GM we often think that it is our role to write plot. We see the sweeping narratives in shows like Critical Role and Dimension 20 and think that it's up to us to write a plot so utterly compelling that it goes this way. 

The narrative will come if you can let the players connect. 

Reinforce effect let the players be the cause. If they lack cause you either didn't prepare or align on the narrative or you haven't applied enough force to tip the first domino. 

Swing for the fences. Don't just let them stub their toe, take them out at the knees.



Narratives in movies and novels are written as beats but we don't actually consume them this way, as separate independent moments. Instead we see narratives as the interconnected pieces between a series of moments. Narrative is the connections between cause and effect looping and looping until the narrative concludes. If this is the case then why do we spend so much time trying to get our players to move between certain beats in a certain order? This juggling act of trying to move the narrative forward while trying to keep it under control is exhausting. It's like seeing a New York dog walker trying to wrangle 4 wild big dogs as they sniff and pull in every direction except the one they intend. Im tired just thinking about it. 

Instead lets take a lesson from the world of improv and focus on just two things, the present moment of   



 consume a narrative and the flow between cause, effect, response which is another cause leading to an effect. This rhythm in a movie is written and scripted however in games this leads to a lack of player agency. 

As GMs then we shouldn't plan around beats or scenarios or even scenes. We should think about building toys. 

My niece is currently 2 years old and loves to play with magna-tiles. She loves the stacking of the blocks and then the crash as they fall. There are no instructions to these they are just a series of geometric shapes with magnets that let them be linked however she wants. How frustrated would she be if instead of letting build and stack and play, every time she did something "wrong" I knocked down her tower and said "That's not how you play with these!". She would quickly go find another uncle to play with. It's no different with our players. If you force them to interact with the world in a certain way or make it so that everything they want to do is irrelevant you're going to find they find another GM to play with. 

If there are differences in what kind of stories you want to build together you need to have a conversation. One player who wants monty python while the other wants berserk are going to find it difficult to collaborate. This comes down to player selection and agreeement but that's another topic entirely.
