Byung chul Han explains that burnout is caused by achievement on a shifting never ending scale. DM burnout then might be understood as the running out of creative fuel or as the strain from constantly striving to entertain or achieve something special behind the screen. We don't often hear about player burnout. I think this is because to the players everything is novel and new. We can leverage some improv skills as Dms to help achieve the same mindset

In improv you are never sure where the scene is headed and that's exciting. Depending on which school you come from the formula for how you get there changes but in general it goes something like this

1. Initiation - Someone starts off the scene by saying somethig
2. Agreement - the scene partners agree with the scene by engaging it using yes and
3. Construct base reality - the players in the scene yes and until they find some sort of status quo and have a setting
4. Twist or Game - The players will as they construct base reality find something weird to engage with. The mailman is putting milk in the mailbox instead of letters, the teacher has a sword, the race car driver just isn't feeling it today. 
5. Raise the stakes - The players then yes and into the twist or odd thing until it reaches some climax
6. Land the plane - the players having hit the biggest part of the scene find someway to resolve it and reestablish a status quo

This narrative arc means that you are never playing the same scene. As DMs we often try and protect our worlds and keep the players on the map we drew or on the kings good side so that the other story beats we planned for can continue. The problem with this is that it's exhausting. If the players want to leave the town let them and ask where they are headed. If they want to run the good and merciful king through with a great sword, let them! This novelty can help keep you surprised and surprise is very fun. This also helps alleviate the exhaustion that DMs can feel from the constant stress of keeping their players inline or their precious plots on track. Let the players off leash and respond in kind. If they leave town and are faced with a dark woodland on the edges of civilization maybe there are eyes staring back at them. Do you know what those eyes are? No idea! What are they going to do about it though? Will they investigate? Will they tell the king? Either way you're going to find out together. 



Another note, this style of play requires you to commit. If the players run the king through with a greatsword and the room is full of guards commit them to their course. You don't need to balance every encounter. If they wish to dive into the deep end let them. If they poke the bear it's going to get very grizzly very quick. Let it.
