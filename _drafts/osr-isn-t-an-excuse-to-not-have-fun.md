Just because you are playing an OSR game doesn't mean that you have an excuse to drag your players through a boring wasteland. Well you didn't tap the *right* stones. You didn't turn the moose head *clockwise* . The point of a game is to have fun. If your style of DMing is leading players to being frustrated that means they don't know what to do and need more hand holding. You could be a good GM and tell them or you could commit to being too clever. I encourage the former and encourage the latter to seek professional help.
