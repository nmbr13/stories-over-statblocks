Backstories are a waste of time. In the same way that no player in the history of TTRPGs has ever read a GM's notes, no GM is interested in reading 2000 words of worldbuilding that has nothing to do with the setting we discussed. Backstories and large world building projects are ultimately an exercise in potential and until they are actualized in the game they don't exist. 

As these thoughts were crystalizing in my head, a friend asked me if I wanted to join into his new DnD campaign at Level 1.



When a friend invited me to play in his new campaign starting at level one I saw an opportunity to experiment. It's been pretty typical to, when starting a new character, begin the game by thinking about who they were in the past, how did they get here, what's their backstory etc. Unfortunately though this is a waste of time. I once had a player author close to 2000 words of backstory in a game I ran and I must admit I skimmed it and then ignored it. It is a waste of time for me to read it and it was a waste of time for him to write something so extensive. 

Additionally backstories are secretly railroads. Someone once told me that if you want to see where you're going look where your past footprints are pointing. Backstories define what the story will be before anyone else at the table has an opportunity to contribute meaningfully. If you give your character a quest, a purpose, a magical artifact they must destroy, what happens when something else happens? You either have to ignore the backstory, or ignore the present moment. Additionally it relegates all the other characters in the story to that of supporting cast lest they be seen as adversarial. 

Here's an alternative. On the extreme end don't plan anything. Just yes and... your way into a place in the story. You walk into a bar... yes and I work here for tips. You are approached by the party who asks for directions...yes and I can even show you around. Don't worry about where they are from or where they are going, just yes and your way into it. 

Another approach that's a little more structured is to only write enough backstory for the 15 minutes before the first scene. I had a friend who said that the start of his campaign is level one and for some reason we are all in prison in a town that hates magic. So my level 1 warlock's backstory was, 

> I was running from raiders, asked the spirit that guarded my hometown for help and she teleported me away where I appeared in this town square surrounded by guards and the slowly falling grass of my hometown. I was arrested and ended up here. 

I had no idea what the name of my town was, who the raiders were, what the name of my patron was. Outside of the work to build a level 1 warlock with an archfey patron, I had no story written. So when the other players began to ask questions I just made it up on the spot. Oh yea.. we're an ancient group of people who....collect grasses aaaannd we're protected by Our Lady of the Green Waves but then the Skull King's troops attacked and now Im here trying to get home. 

The only story that matters is the one that you develop with your friends at the table. If the players never asked about my hometown I don't know that it would ever exist. This style of play is so fun and open and it allows the other players at the table to engage.
